summary: Verify convert2rhel can handle dependency pkgs
description: |
    This test will install a couple of packages that we know cause dependency
    problems during the package replacement, so the intention of this is to
    assert that convert2rhel can handle those packages and not fail during the
    replacement, especially with the yum transaction.


test: |
  pytest -svv
